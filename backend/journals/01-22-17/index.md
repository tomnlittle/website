## Why
I wanted to further my knowledge and understanding of C++, whilst working with cameras and image processing.

## What does the project do ?
The github project is more of a library than a fully fledged application, I have used it to kickstart a number of other projects such as a little CCTV Pi camera.

## What did I learn from the project ?
The project gave me a small glimpse into the world of multi-threading which I hadn't experienced in a language such as C++ before. Although this was a small project that didn't have many, if any, race conditions; learning the basics and understanding what the core concepts are was an important skill for me to learn one year into my university degree.

## There are a couple of other mini projects in the Git repo, what are those ?
Once I finished the main camera interface I decided I wanted to experiment a bit.

I tried my hand at some stereo camera systems and basic colour based object detection; both of which you can find in the repo.
