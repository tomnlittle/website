## What is it ?
During the first semester of each year, the UNSW create society have participated in an inter-university competition. The competition sees teams pit  autonomous RC cars against each other around a race track and obstacle course.

The winning team of the competition go to Queensland to race against the best of a number of interstate teams.

## What was the plan ?
My team consisted of myself and two other members. We bought an RC car, and it was the job of one of the members to design the hardware fittings to hold our Raspberry Pi in place inside the car.

Myself and the other member were in charge of designing. I used the Opencv-Interface library that I had previously created as a side project, and some code that I borrowed off of my Raspberry Pi Quadcopter project to get the project started.

I then worked on a library to control the steering and speed of the RC car before beginning work on the NN.

## What went wrong ?
Our project team didn't work effectively as a team, and the project was never finished. The basic code to drive the car was completed, but no other stage of the project was started by the other two members.

## What did I learn and what would I do differently next time ?
Honestly I developed my team working skills as a result of this project. This was a frustrating project team to be a part of. If I had addressed my concerns about the progression of the project with the other members it might have gotten further down the road.
